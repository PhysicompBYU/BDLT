# BDLT

This is the code to receive serial data from the BDL's in java. Included in this branch are:
1. the files that were added to the package. 
2. the actual .java program that uses them.

When the code is run it prompts the user for the COM Port number (eg: device is on COM37 so user types '37' when prompted) this can be removed BUT if it is then the number of the port must altered in the code EVERY time a different BDL is connected to the computer. The user is also prompted for a filepath, this is provided as an example of saving the data to a file purely as a courtesy and should be removed if not desired.
